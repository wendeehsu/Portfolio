                    Since users are not able to try on the color contact lens before buying, their hesitation about whether the color suits them may set them back while purchasing. As a result, we cooperated with Formosa Optical, one of the largest glass retailer in Taiwan, to develop an iOS app that enables users to virtually wear color contact lens.

                        We bought an offline executable software development kit that captures face data perfectly, combining it to implement the customized Len-wearing algorithm with OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library.

                                This is my first time to develop a pure iOS app. In the past, I used to learn step by step from following tutorials on Codecademy to finishing little applications later. However, since the project has a strict deadline this time, I had no choice but to jump into development right away. Checking what feature needs to be done next, I searched for resources online that taught me how to implement it. I certainly encountered a lot of problems since I didn’t even know the basics in Swift and Objective C. Nevertheless, I quickly build up the knowledge in the process of troubleshooting.

                                After my team member finished the computer vision algorithm using C++, I was in charge of executing it on iOS along with all the rest of the frontend development. During that time, I had little knowledge of both computer vision and iOS development. As a result, I was aimless when the app was not working. It took me months struggling on my own but in vain. I later decided to ask my team members for help (and also posted questions on the developer’s forum.) Things became much easier when others provided their previous experience. With their assistance, I not only learned how computer vision worked but was also able to solve similar questions posted by other developers on the forum.

                                Having no experience in working for people outside the school, our team jumped into development before any contract was done. We later realized the owner kept demanding new functions and requirements during our cooperation. The suffering of project creeping was real, using up extra time and effort but not receiving any additional payments. From this experience, we found out how important a contract was as it will serve as protection under this situation.
