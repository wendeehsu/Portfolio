                    Since users are not able to try on the color contact lens before buying, their hesitation about whether the color suits them may set them back while purchasing. As a result, we cooperated with Formosa Optical, one of the largest glass retailer in Taiwan, to develop an iOS app that enables users to virtually wear color contact lens.

                        We bought an offline executable software development kit that captures face data perfectly, combining it to implement the customized Len-wearing algorithm with OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library.
